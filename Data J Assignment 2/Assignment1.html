    <h1>Anti-extradition protest in Hong Kong</b> </h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
    In Feburary 2019, in response to a murder case committed by a Hong Kong citizen in Taiwan, the Hong Kong government firstly proposed the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance which allows transfering fugitives to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.
    </p>

    <p>The juridictions includes:<br>
    <ol>
        <li>Mainland China</li>
        <li>Taiwan</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
    The inclusion of mainland China in the amendment is of concern to different sectors of Hong Kong society. Pro-democracy advocates fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from mainland Chinese laws administered by the Communist Party, thereby eroding the "one country, two systems" principle in practice since the 1997 handover. Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other avenues, such as establishing an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to sunset the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect.
