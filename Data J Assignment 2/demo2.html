      Opposition to the extradition agreement has been snowballing ever since it was announced in February. Domestic and international concerns have been expressed about the possibility of politically motivated persecution and unfair trials on the mainland.
      People have taken to the streets in huge numbers to protest the bill, including last Sunday, when, according to organisers, 1.03 million people marched. Police put the figure at 240,000.
